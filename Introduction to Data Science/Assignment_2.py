# # Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
# All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
# ## Part 1
# The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 
# 
# The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# In[2]:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()


# ### Question 0 (Example)
# 
# What is the first country in df?
# 
# *This function should return a Series.*

# In[3]:

# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
#answer_zero() 


# ### Question 1
# Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[4]:

import numpy as np
def answer_one():
    result_df = df[df["Gold"] == np.max(df["Gold"])]
    x = result_df['ID']
    return ' '.join(x.to_string().split()[:-1])
#answer_one()


# ### Question 2
# Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[5]:

def answer_two():
    df['diff_sm_wn_gl'] = abs(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1'])
    result_df = df[df['diff_sm_wn_gl'] == np.max(df['diff_sm_wn_gl'])]
    return ' '.join(result_df['ID'].to_string().split()[:-1])
#answer_two()


# ### Question 3
# Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 
# 
# $$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$
# 
# Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[6]:

def answer_three():
    atleast_one_gold = df[(df['Gold'] > 0) & (df['Gold.1'] > 0)]
    atleast_one_gold['result'] = atleast_one_gold['diff_sm_wn_gl'] / atleast_one_gold['Gold.2']
    result_series = atleast_one_gold[atleast_one_gold['result'] == np.max(atleast_one_gold['result'])]
    return result_series['ID'].to_string().split()[0]
#answer_three()


# ### Question 4
# Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created, with the country names as indices.
# 
# *This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*

# In[7]:


def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = (df['Gold.2'] * 3) + (df['Silver.2'] * 2) + df['Bronze.2']
    return df['Points']
#answer_four()


# ## Part 2
# For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2015/co-est2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
# 
# The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
# 
# ### Question 5
# Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[40]:

census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
#census_df.sort_values(by = ['CENSUS2010POP'], ascending = False)
#census_df


# In[44]:

from collections import defaultdict
def answer_five():
    new = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    newdict = {}
    for state in new['STNAME']:
        newdict[state] = newdict.get(state, 0) + 1
    x = sorted(newdict.items(), key = lambda entry: entry[1])
    return x[-1][0]
#answer_five()


# ### Question 6
# **Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state**, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.
# 
# *This function should return a list of string values.*

# In[66]:


def answer_six():
    new = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    newdict = defaultdict(list)
    for state, pop in zip(new['STNAME'], new['CENSUS2010POP']):
        newdict[state].append(int(pop))
        newdict[state].sort(reverse = True)
    
    #x = sorted(newdict.items(), key = lambda entry: entry[1])
    #return x[-1][0]
    for key in newdict:
        if len(newdict[key]) == 1:
            newdict[key] = newdict[key][0]
        elif len(newdict[key]) == 2:
            newdict[key] = newdict[key][0] + newdict[key][1]
        else:
            newdict[key] = newdict[key][0] + newdict[key][1] + newdict[key][2]
    #print(type(newdict['Alabama'][0]))
    x = sorted(newdict.items(), key = lambda entry: entry[1], reverse = True)
    return_populas_states = []
    for index in range(3):
        return_populas_states.append(x[index][0])
    return return_populas_states
answer_six()


# ### Question 7
# Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)
# 
# e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.
# 
# *This function should return a single string value.*

# In[28]:

def answer_seven():
    result_df = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV'] == 50]
    result_df = result_df.loc[:, ['CTYNAME', 'POPESTIMATE2010','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2012', 
    'POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2015']]
    result_df['abs_change'] = result_df.max(1) - result_df.min(axis = 1)
    county = result_df[result_df['abs_change'] == np.max(result_df['abs_change'])]
    return ' '.join(county['CTYNAME'].to_string().split()[-2:])
#answer_seven()


# ### Question 8
# In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 
# 
# Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.
# 
# *This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*

# In[29]:

def answer_eight():
    new_df = census_df[((census_df['REGION'] == 1) | (census_df['REGION'] == 2)) & (census_df['POPESTIMATE2015'] > census_df['POPESTIMATE2014']) & (census_df['CTYNAME'].str.startswith('Washington'))]
    return new_df.loc[:, ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME']]
